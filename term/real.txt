The Story of Mel
A Real Programmer

This is a story about a Real Programmer. The company I work for does
systems programming, and we have a few Real Programmers working here.
The story concerns a Real Programmer working on our Blackjack program
for the PDP-8.

Now, the PDP-8 was a simple machine. It had 4K of memory (if you were
lucky), a paper-tape reader, and a Teletype. The Blackjack program was
meant to run in a mere 4K, and include the dealer, the game logic, and
a reasonably snappy interface.

The Real Programmer was working on this program. He was having problems
getting it to fit in 4K. Every time he finished one subroutine, he'd
discover that he'd used up more memory than he had available for the
rest of the program.

The Real Programmer never used comments, his code was self-documenting.
He never used structured programming constructs, they were for wimps who
couldn't remember what they were doing. He never used a high-level
language, they were for people who couldn't handle the machine.

When the Real Programmer finished the Blackjack program, it was a work
of art. The program was so tightly coded that every instruction was
used for multiple purposes. He had no extra memory, no wasted cycles.

But there was one small problem. The program had a bug. Sometimes, when
you asked for a card, the program would deal you the same card twice.
The Real Programmer knew about this bug, but he couldn't fix it without
adding more code, and there was no more room.

So the Real Programmer did what Real Programmers do. He documented the
bug as a feature. "The program will occasionally deal duplicate cards.
This simulates the experience of playing with a deck that hasn't been
properly shuffled."

The Real Programmer's name was Mel.

And Mel was a Real Programmer.

This story has been passed down through generations of programmers as
an example of the old-school programming mentality, where memory was
precious and every byte counted. It represents both the ingenuity and
the stubbornness of early computer programmers who worked within
extreme constraints.

The story is often told to illustrate the difference between "clever"
programming and maintainable programming, and serves as both a tribute
to and a gentle critique of the programming practices of yesteryear.
